# Gamified Healthcare Questionnaires

Healthcare questionnaires, surveys, and intake forms are essential for delivering high-quality care by providing insights into patients' demographics, medical history, preferences, and experiences. However, traditional paper-based forms can lead to fatigue, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete data and reduced engagement. This project aims to address this issue by developing a digital interface that can convert any form or questionnaire into an interactive and gamified version to enhance user engagement.

## Challenge

Design a digital interface capable of transforming any form or questionnaire into an interactive gamified version, effectively reducing user fatigue.

## Project Repository

The project repository can be found at [Responsive-Form](https://github.com/Kaarthik-07/Responsive-Form.git). It includes the source code, documentation, and resources related to the development of the gamified healthcare questionnaire interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Rendering:** The interface dynamically renders any form or questionnaire provided to it.
  
- **Gamified Elements:** Integrate gamified elements such as progress bars, achievements, and rewards to enhance user engagement.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure that the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, catering to users of varying technical expertise.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kaarthik-07/Responsive-Form.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running locally. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the gamified healthcare questionnaire interface.

## Usage

Describe how users can utilize the interface to convert and interact with healthcare forms in a gamified manner. Include any specific instructions or examples that may be helpful.
